# GasCert

This flutter application aims to simplify the data entry process for Gas Safety certificates. 

The application uses numerous packages to achieve the intended goal, including flutter_pdfview to create and view PDF files that contain user entered data, image_picker to allow for the custom entry of user company
logos, and cloud_firestore to enable the application to store and access data using the Firestore cloud database. 

The application contains pages to allow for data entry which include sub-pages for each section of the Gas Safety certificate, and a page to view previous reports created by a user, which includes a search feature to filter reports, any report can be clicked on in this page to view the data contained within the report or to turn the report into a PDF file which can be shared externally or printed.
